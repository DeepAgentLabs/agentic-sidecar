# AIOS 0.8.0 operational-artifact compatibility

AIOS repository v0.8.0 adds exploratory verification_signal, audit_event and
investigation_report companion artifacts under **0.8-draft**, with incident
context and operator summaries. Earlier Run/Workflow remain 0.4-draft and
provenance remains 0.6-draft. Independent review and coordinated v1.0 gates
remain open.

## Decisions and audit records

AuditRecord decision_id/timestamp/outcome and causal links inform audit_event. Preserve native identity/outcome and use unknown actor when absent. BLOCK can describe denial at the decision boundary; ALLOW does not prove execution succeeded. Omit trigger.arguments, execution_context and privileged intent/context from shared evidence. Existing native audit contracts are not automatically 0.6-draft provenance or 0.8-draft audit events. This change adds no exporter or validator support.

## Optional adoption

The [AIOS 0.8.0 compatibility matrix](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/blob/v0.8.0/docs/v0.8.0-ecosystem.md)
and [schemas, examples and rules](https://github.com/DeepAgentLabs/ai-operations-spec/tree/v0.8.0/specification/v0.8)
define the projection contract. The examples are synthetic projections of
inspected sibling shapes, not output from shipped sibling adapters.

A future adapter needs schema and semantic checks, source/native identity,
explicit unavailable/unknown states, redaction and unknown-extension
preservation. Register schemas by full $id, route by the document's own marker
and reject unsupported marker/type pairs. Source/citation presence does not
authenticate a producer or verify its conclusion; reference URIs are not
instructions to fetch or execute anything.

## Dependencies and release

This is documentation alignment only. Existing runtime and native contracts
are unchanged. No AIOS Python runtime dependency, optional dependency floor
increase or package patch release is needed. New artifact adoption requires an
explicit implementation and release in the owning package. Roll back optional
companion emission without relabeling it as an older artifact family.
