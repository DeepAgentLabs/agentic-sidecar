"""`DecisionContext` -- what gets passed to every evaluator (Policy, Risk,
and, from v0.2, Intent Guardian) at a decision boundary.

`DecisionContext` itself carries only a lightweight `IntentSnapshot`, not
the full `IntentEnvelope` (that lives in `agentic_sidecar.intent.envelope`,
which `core/` does not depend on -- see `IntentEnvelope.to_snapshot()`).
This matches concept.md §7, Intent Injection: only the relevant intent
needs to reach each decision boundary, not the whole envelope. `metadata`
remains the escape hatch for anything a custom `@sidecar.before_tool_call`
hook or future evaluator wants to attach without a breaking change here.

    `agentic_sidecar.adapters.langgraph`) only needs to supply `tool_name`

    injects `intent`/`history` by mutating the instance the caller passed

    `SidecarBlockedError` after the call gets the context Intent Guardian
