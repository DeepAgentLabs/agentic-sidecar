"""Exceptions raised by adapters when a Sidecar's Decision Gate blocks a
proposed action in Govern mode (v0.2+).

Not raised by `Sidecar.evaluate()` itself -- a `BLOCK` `Decision` is a
normal outcome, not a Python exception. Turning it into a raised exception
(and thereby actually stopping the call) is each adapter's job at its own
interception point, not core's (AGENTS.md's Package Boundaries: adapters
depend on core, not the reverse -- `core/` has no opinion on what "stopping
a call" means for a given framework).
